ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = y)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)

# while the graph as is shows the general distribution and trends as a whole, but the far right tail values are essentially illegible
# due to their small value overall. Adding in cood_cartesian() funcion allows you to zoom in on this specific difficult to see range.
# It's also very useful when you want to see a specific range without distorting the overall data and keeping the axis scaling consistent.

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = y)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))

# Here you can see it is used to zoom in on the bars that have less than 50, without removing the other bars.
# Ideally you will want to use this to view a specific subset of data among a larger dataset that is difficult to visualize within the base graphic
